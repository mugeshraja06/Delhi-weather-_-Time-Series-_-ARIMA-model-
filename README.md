### Delhi_weather_Time-Series_ARIMA
Build the models to forecast the temperature ranges in Delhi from 2017 to 2018 


Objective: We have chosen Delhiâ€™s weather data from the year 2000 to 2018. Our ultimate goal is to forecast the temperature on 2017 to 2018 based on the parameter is given in the Dataset by train them using data from 2000 to 2016.   

Outcome: We were able to build the models to forecast the temperature ranges in Delhi from 2017 to 2018 by using influential factors for the decision so that we can produce efficient and precise weather reports.
